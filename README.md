Overview
This APP helps indecisive users choose which movie or TV show to watch. They can find a movie or TV show by title keyword/s or key phrase. The “Search” button takes in any character/s and returns 20 posters. The “Surprise Movie” Genre button picks a random genre and displays up to 20 posters. 
Clicking on a poster shows a modal panel with title, tagline, embedded youtube video, genres, director, cast list; and most importantly, review scores of three major review sites: IMDB, rotten tomatoes and metacritic. On top of this stylish pop-up modal is the average score derived from the three values. 
This is a cool and awesome APP that runs on mobiles and will provide a busy, mobile user find instant entertainment ideas on the go.  It allows a group of people choose movies and TV shows based on relative objective critic reviews.
